# SimulatedAnnealingAlgorithm
We want to minimize the Easom function of two variables:
Simulated Annealing was coded for the Easom Function
The function is usually evaluated on the square xi ∈ [-100, 100], for all i = 1, 2
The Easom function is plotted in the below figure for xi ∈ [-10, 10], for all i = 1, 2.
This function is similar to a needle-in-a-hay function. The global optimum is restricted in a very small region.
